## Setup 👩🏽‍💻

##### Firebase 🔥

1. Create new [Firebase Project](https://firebase.google.com/)
2. Upgrade your project to Blaze Plan (Pay as you go)
3. Enable Google as a sign-in method in the Firebase console:
   - In the Firebase console, open the Auth section.
   - On the Sign in method tab, enable the Google sign-in method and click Save.
4. Enable Firestore (Production Rules)
5. Add a new Web application to your project
6. Clone this repo and open it in the editor of your choice
7. Replace [`firebaseConfig.json`](https://github.com/mdichtler/EMS/blob/2b455ea09692d1318874207e48ab27d6e2bc6e0e/web/src/firebaseConfig.json#L2-L7) with config generated by Firebase.
8. Replace value of `default` inside [`.firebaserc`](https://github.com/mdichtler/EMS/blob/2b455ea09692d1318874207e48ab27d6e2bc6e0e/.firebaserc#L5) with your new Project ID
9. Run `npm run deploy` in the home directory of the project.
   - This will update your Firebase Security Rules, upload Functions, build the web app and deploy it to Firebase Hosting
10. Go to Firebase Console and ensure that everything has been deployed correctly from step #9
11. Go to Hosting section of Firebase Console, and select one of the two deploy (default) URLs.

##### App Configuration ⚛️

1. After navigating to the default deploy URL, click Login in the top right corner
2. As the first user visiting the app, you'll be asked to enter Owner email (superadmin, only way to strip permissions is directly in the database), this will default to your email, and it should stay that way if you want to complete this setup.
   (If you have entered someone else's email, please ask them to sign in after clicking `Create` button, and continue from step #3)
   You can also enter company name, and logo URL that will be reflected in the header of the page - don't worry you can always change this later!

3. Select "Global Settings" from the Drawer menu on the left, and navigate to the EMS tab. Check the `Enabled` checkbox at the top, and click on `Save`. After refreshing the page you should be able to see EMS option in the left menu.

4. You can add new fields by clicking the `Add` button next to "Fields", this will create a new row.
   - each row starts with the `Field Name`, and `Field ID` in parenthases. `Field ID` is derived from the `Field Name` and should always be unique.
   - you can further select data type based on the options inside the Select menu.
   - Selecting `Required` will add required flag to the input fields when creating / editing profile
   - Selecting `Table Field` will expose the field in the table, visible in the EMS section of the app.
5. Below the field rows, you can edit permissions of users to access the EMS section. By default, each user has access to their own profile, assuming their sign in (Google Auth) `Email` is identical to the one on their profile. Adding users in this table will give them permissions to either read or write any EMS profile, or with Admin access, also configure the App.
6. Always save your changes using the `Save` button in the top right corner.
7. API (TBA)

###### Final notes:

There are two fields that are required for each profile, `User ID` that can't be set by anyone but the profile owner & `Email`, referring to the email they use to authenticate with the app. These fields cannot be removed, as they tie to core functionality of the app, if editing data manually _this is heavily discouraged_, ensure to not remove these fields.
`User ID` is further represented as `Link Account` button, allowing user one time action, to link their Firebase Authentication, directly with their EMS profile, allowing you to read their `Firebase UUID` via the API.
